IoT app for bmp180 sensor
BMP180 Windows IoT Project


Lets Get Started!
In this project, we will use Windows 10 IoT Core to get sensor readings from a BMP180 Digital Barometric Pressure Sensor over I2C bus. Its simple to get things running with the library provided. So lets get started!



The Hardware.
First of all we need to get acquainted with the hardware! The BMP180 is a Digital Barometric Pressure Sensor created by Bosch Sensortec. There are many breakout variations out in the market. You need to be extra careful on the input voltage of the breakout module because there is a possibility to destroy it if you connect it wrong. The sensor itself works on max 3.6V, according to Bosch tech specs. Some breakouts support 3.3V input voltage, others 5V and there are also some which support both 3.3V and 5V.
